# Temperature-Telegram-Bot-with-NodeMcu

## Introduction 
In this tutotrial we will go through how to do one-way (Google Assistant to NodeMcu) communication with NodeMcu using Google Assistant. 

## Prerequisites
In order to complete this tutorial, you will need to have NodeMcu ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and Google Assistant should be installed in your mobile phone.

- **NODEMCU ESP8266 Wifi Controller**
- **1 LED light**

You will need to perform the following tasks before you can start this guide:
- **Install Google Assistant if your are _iPhone_ user**
- **Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) together with [NodeMcu](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit/tree/master/Drivers) driver**: We will be using Arduino IDE to write and deploy our code to NodeMcu board and for this you should have Arduino IDE installed in your machine tgether with NodeMcu driver. 
- **Create an account at [IFTT](https://ifttt.com/)**: If This Then That, also known as IFTTT, is a free web-based service to create chains of simple conditional statements, called applets.
- **Create an account at [Adafruit](https://io.adafruit.com/)**: Adafruit will help us to recieve signals from IFTT to NodeMcu board.
